			<h2>Jeff from Sheldon </h2>
			<img class="jobimg" alt="Testimonial Image" src="./images/image2.jpg" style="width:30%">
			<p>Arcadia did a fantastic job fitting my kitchen. They provided very high-quality units and worktops. The materials are far better than I've seen samples of on the market locally. The service far exceeded my expectations. Will recommend to friends and family.</p>

			<h2>Bob from Sheldon </h2>
			<img class="jobimg" alt="Testimonial Image" src="./images/image6.jpg" style="width:30%">
			<p>We wanted to let you know how delighted we are with the recently fitted kitchen as well as the quality of service your company has provided. We really appreciate how friendly and professional you have been throughout, from the initial enquiry through to the after sales visit. All appointments and deadlines were promptly adhered to and the responsiveness to our revised plans, the attention to detail and the way you conduct business was particularly appreciated. </p>

			<h2>Bill from Coventry </h2>
			<img class="jobimg" alt="Testimonial Image" src="./images/image4.jpg" style="width:30%">
			<p>I am writing to you regarding my recent experience of having my Kitchen designed by Arcadia at the Birmingham branch. We decided to have a supporting wall removed and quite extensive building work, I have to say that from start to finish it has been expertly coordinated by Dariusz who came up with several ideas for our Kitchen, utility room & dining room conversion. </p>

			<h2>Will from Small Heath </h2>
			<img class="jobimg" alt="Testimonial Image" src="./images/image5.jpg" style="width:30%">
			<p>Arcadia offer excellent quality in design, manufacture, fitting and customer service. We were always made to fell very welcome at the showroom. Dariusz was the only kitchen designer we met who actually listened to what we wanted from our kitchen and how we planned to use it. From our first meeting he immediately recognised that we wanted something a little bit different and came up with an innovative design that we are delighted with.</p>
